## Showcasing my Markdown skills:

I am using Markdown to _italicize_ and make words __bold__.

Here is a link to [github](https://github.com/).

> This is a blockquote

I can also list things
* like this
* and that

Sometimes the list needs order
1. like that
2. or this

And as a programmer, I will also need to be able to show `inline code`.

```
or code blocks
to display code

std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
```
